It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate conditional statements.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

47: No, it does not change when an error message is printed. Inserting 0 should give the same effect as inserting a negative number.
48: It simply allows 0 to be used.
50: That feature allows 2D objects to appear on a board for anything Java related. Without it, we would'nt be able to create interactible
objects.
51: The insertMoney call now only increases the balance if possible, the total only increases from the price each time we use the printTicket call
and the balance now doesn't get reduced to 0 after printing a ticket, but instead decreases by the price count.
52: Yes, but it no longer tells you how many more cents you need to print a new ticket.
53: No, because the If statement checks if the balance is greater or equal to the price.
54: The multiplication (*), the division (/) and the modulus (%)
58: The println version was easier to understand.
59: It reduces the balance to 0 before the return statement.
60: The statement does not work because it is placed after the return statement.
